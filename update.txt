You are a senior frontend engineer.

Goal: Refactor my current 2-page static landing site into a clean structure that separates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while keeping all existing functionality exactly the same (especially the working form submission to my email via Netlify).

Context:
- This is a static site deployed on Netlify (no build step required).
- Currently everything is likely inline (styles/scripts embedded in HTML).
- There are two HTML pages (landing + another page).
- The forms already work and must continue to work.

Tasks:
1) Create this folder/file structure (or adapt to what exists, but keep it simple):
/index.html
/<second-page>.html
/assets/css/styles.css
/assets/js/main.js
/assets/js/forms.js  (optional if forms logic exists)
/assets/img/  (optional)

2) Update BOTH HTML pages to:
- Link the external stylesheet: <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/styles.css">
- Link external JS scripts at the bottom before </body>:
  <script src="/assets/js/main.js" defer></script>
  <script src="/assets/js/forms.js" defer></script> (only if needed)

3) Move all CSS from <style> tags and inline style attributes into styles.css.
- Keep the visual appearance identical.
- Use CSS variables for primary colors if appropriate.
- Preserve responsive behavior.
- Do NOT introduce frameworks.

4) Move all JavaScript from <script> tags into main.js (and forms.js if helpful).
- Keep button click behaviors the same.
- Keep any smooth scrolling / menu toggles / modals / FAQ toggles working.
- Do not change IDs/classes unless strictly necessary; if you change them, update CSS/JS accordingly.

5) Form behavior requirements (critical):
- Preserve Netlify Forms attributes exactly so emails keep working:
  - form must keep: name="..." method="POST" data-netlify="true"
  - include a hidden input: <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="FORM_NAME">
  - keep any existing netlify-honeypot if present
- If there is a custom JS submit handler, ensure it does NOT break Netlify’s native form submission.
  - If you intercept submit, you must still POST correctly or let the browser submit normally.
- Keep thank-you behavior intact (redirect or message).

6) Output:
- Provide the full updated contents of each file you changed/created:
  - index.html
  - <second-page>.html
  - /assets/css/styles.css
  - /assets/js/main.js
  - /assets/js/forms.js (if used)
- Do not omit code with “…” — I need complete files.

7) Safety checks:
- After refactor, confirm all links work on Netlify (use absolute root paths starting with /).
- Confirm both pages render correctly when opened directly.
- Confirm forms still submit and are detected by Netlify.

Now proceed. First, briefly describe what you found in the current files (where styles/scripts are), then output the complete refactored files.
